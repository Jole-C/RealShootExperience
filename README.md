# RealShootExperience
Portfolio repository for university project.
# This project is on hiatus until further notice!
Due to a mix of personal and computer issues, this project won't be updated for the foreseeable future. It is in a complete state with few bugs, and work was being done to polish it into a proper project that could ditch the university label. This will still happen, but has been delayed until these issues are solved.

# Details
This is a project originally made for university. The plan was to make something small with simple mechanics, but with mechanics I knew I could program well. For this, I decided to make a Devil Daggers inspired wave based FPS.

The project is written in a mix of Blueprints and C++, with focus on backend systems being in C++ as well as scaffolding for Blueprints. The plan was to polish it up and release it as a full game (with a name change!)

### Important note:
Due to the WIP nature of this project, there are several loose odds and ends from the process of converting it from a university project with a time limit to a much bigger and more polished project.
